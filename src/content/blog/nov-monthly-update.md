Hello @here!

Happy weekend! It's been a busy month!

We received $3,858.26 from DSPs
We paid out $3,493 into balances
All time we have paid out $22,446 to members, with 13,324,687 units
We've successfully been handling vinyl fulfilment in the US and EU!
We're now over 1500 tracks managed

Most significantly, we are now also officially a registered UK non-profit company! and fm limited.
This also means we're changing bank accounts and etc, and we'll keep you all informed on if we need any action - likely specifically to do with officially signing up to be a member of the non-profit with a written agreement. Between this all, this will help third parties like DSPs, trade associations or licensing groups take us far more seriously, which is great for our journey to get the best rates.

Regarding tiktok which I mentioned in my last update - Revelator struck a deal with tiktok outside of Merlin, so music will continue to be available there. It is yet to be seen what royalty rates were agreed and how they differ from the previous Merlin deal, but expect it to be just as disappointing as last time.

We've also been provided with a new system for Spotify Discovery Mode - so if you'd like to make use of it and try out a track or two on there that you haven't previously, drop us a message and we can talk about if we think it would be a useful thing for you.

Up next:
Continued re-write of our admin dashboard in preparation for moving some account management items there alongside improving our physicals handling (Nick has been hard at work!)
Get all up to speed with our accountant on the structure and our tax liabilities so we're concrete on things we need to pay out and what our surplus looks like before talking re membership to trade associations like AIM

Also thanks for helping us close so many support tickets this month!

As always, any questions, suggestions or complaints - please let us know!
