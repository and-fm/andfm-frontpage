We've been preparing for the next evolution of and.fm. I can't in good conscience call this an actual 2.0 update, its not _that_ big. But I would say it's the most work we've done since our initial setup and taking on Wave 1 members.

### The Big Achievements Worth Noting

- We have become an official non-profit mutual trade, each of our members have voting rights, and we have a board that represents them.
- We've lowered the shipping cost for the consumers of international physical merch orders for labels based in the United States.
- We have a new website (this one here!), which helps better communicate our vision for the future of the music industry.
- Under the hood we have been working hard on our infrastructure so that we will be ready to open up for a Wave 2 of members and beyond.

If any of this sounds interesting to you _at all_, then please get in touch!
